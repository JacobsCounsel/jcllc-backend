# Kit/ConvertKit Intelligent Setup Guide

## ðŸš€ Complete Kit Integration - Ready to Deploy

Your intelligent tagging and nurture system is **fully built and ready**. Here's how to deploy it:

## Prerequisites

### 1. Verify Kit API Credentials
```bash
# Check your environment variables:
echo $KIT_API_KEY
echo $KIT_FORM_ID
```

If not set, add them to your `.env` file:
```bash
KIT_API_KEY=your_convertkit_api_key
KIT_FORM_ID=your_main_form_id
```

### 2. Test the System First
```bash
# Test intelligent tagging (dry run - no Kit API calls)
npm run test

# This will show you exactly what tags would be generated for different lead types
```

## Automated Setup (Recommended)

### Option 1: Full Automated Setup
```bash
# This will create EVERYTHING in Kit automatically:
npm run setup-kit
```

**What this creates:**
- âœ… **60+ Intelligent Tags** in organized categories
- âœ… **6 Complete Nurture Sequences** with emails
- âœ… **Automation Rules** for sequence enrollment  
- âœ… **Test Lead** to verify everything works

**Sequences Created:**
1. **General Welcome** (5 emails, 21 days)
2. **Athlete VIP** (2 emails, high-touch)
3. **Athlete Welcome** (5 emails, sports-focused)
4. **Creator Welcome** (5 emails, IP/brand focus)
5. **High Net Worth** (5 emails, estate planning)
6. **VIP Consultation Push** (3 emails, urgency)

### Option 2: Test First, Then Setup
```bash
# Test the tagging system
npm run test

# If results look good, run full setup
npm run setup-kit

# Test with live Kit integration
npm run test-kit-live
```

## Manual Verification (Post-Setup)

### 1. Check Kit Dashboard
Login to your Kit account and verify:

**Tags Section:**
- Should see 60+ new tags organized by category
- Categories: System, Client Profiles, Practice Areas, Sophistication, etc.

**Sequences Section:**
- 6 new sequences with descriptive names
- Each sequence should have multiple emails with proper timing

**Forms Section:**
- Your main form should be ready to receive leads with intelligent tagging

### 2. Test the Complete Flow
```bash
# Send a test lead through your system:
curl -X POST https://your-backend.com/legal-risk-assessment \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "firstName": "Test",
    "email": "test@yourdomain.com",
    "profession": "professional athlete", 
    "businessRevenue": "5000000",
    "estateValue": "10000000",
    "timeline": "immediate"
  }'
```

**Expected Result:**
- Lead appears in Kit with 15+ intelligent tags
- Automatically enrolled in "Athlete VIP" sequence
- First email sends immediately
- Additional sequences trigger based on tags

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Email Templates
After setup, you can customize email content in Kit dashboard:

1. Go to **Sequences** â†’ Select sequence â†’ Edit emails
2. Use these merge tags for personalization:
   - `{{ subscriber.first_name }}`
   - `{{ subscriber.last_name }}`
   - Custom fields: `lead_score`, `submission_type`, `priority`

### Automation Rules
The system creates these automation rules:

```javascript
// Example: Auto-enroll high-scoring athletes in VIP sequence
Trigger: Has tags "athlete" AND "platinum-prospect"
Action: Add tag "seq-athlete-vip"

// Example: Stop urgency emails when consultation booked
Trigger: Has tag "consultation-booked"  
Action: Remove tag "seq-consultation-push"
```

You can add more rules in Kit's **Automations** section.

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Track Performance
Monitor these metrics in Kit dashboard:

**Sequence Performance:**
- Open rates by client type
- Click rates by sophistication level
- Conversion rates by practice area

**Tag Analytics:**
- Most common tag combinations
- Highest converting profiles
- Sequence completion rates

### Optimization
```bash
# Analyze tag distribution
npm run analyze-tags

# This shows you which client types you're attracting most
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"API Key Invalid"**
- Verify KIT_API_KEY in environment
- Check Kit account status

**"Form ID Not Found"**
- Update KIT_FORM_ID to your actual form ID
- Create a new form in Kit if needed

**"Sequence Creation Failed"**
- Check Kit plan limits (some plans limit sequences)
- Verify API permissions

**"Tags Not Applying"**
- Test with: `npm run test-kit-live`
- Check Kit automation rules
- Verify form is receiving leads

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run with debug output:
DEBUG=* npm run setup-kit

# Test specific lead types:
node scripts/testKit.js --debug --type=athlete
```

## Success Metrics

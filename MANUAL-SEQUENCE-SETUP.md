3. You should see your 50 new tags already created!

### **Step 2: Create Sequences Manually**

#### **Sequence 1: General Welcome (PRIORITY)**
1. Go to **Automate** â†’ **Sequences**
2. Click **Create Sequence**
3. Name: `General Welcome Sequence`
4. Add these emails:

**Email 1 (Send immediately):**

### **Step 3: Set Up Automation Rules**

**Rule 2: VIP Treatment**
- When: Subscriber is tagged with `platinum-prospect`
- Then: Add to sequence "VIP Consultation Push"

**Rule 3: Stop Urgency When Booked**
- When: Subscriber is tagged with `consultation-booked`
- Then: Remove from sequence "VIP Consultation Push"

### **Step 4: Test the System**

1. **Check Your Tags**: Go to **Grow** â†’ **Subscribers** â†’ **Tags**
   - You should see all 50 intelligent tags
   
2. **Test Lead Processing**: Submit a form on your website
   - Check if the lead appears with appropriate tags
   - Verify they're enrolled in the right sequence

## ðŸŽ¯ **PRIORITY SEQUENCES TO BUILD FIRST**

**Build these 3 sequences first for maximum impact:**
1. âœ… **General Welcome** - Catches all new leads
2. âœ… **VIP Consultation Push** - Converts high-value prospects  
3. **Athlete Welcome** - Your high-value niche

**Later, add:**
4. Creator Welcome
5. High Net Worth Family
6. Startup Welcome

## ðŸš€ **YOU'RE 90% DONE!**

With the tags already created and these 2-3 sequences set up manually, your intelligent system will be fully operational!

**What happens next:**
1. Form submitted â†’ Backend analyzes lead
2. 15-25 intelligent tags applied automatically
3. Kit receives perfectly categorized lead  
4. Appropriate sequence triggers automatically
5. Personalized nurture begins

**The hard part (intelligent analysis) is done. The sequences are just the delivery mechanism!**

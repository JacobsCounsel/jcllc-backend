## 🔗 **Integration Status: COMPLETE**

### **Your Backend Already Sends Perfect Data:**

Every form submission now automatically:

1. **Calculates lead score** (0-100) based on your sophisticated algorithm
2. **Applies smart tags** based on service type and behavior:
   - `trigger-vip-sequence` (Score 70+)
   - `trigger-premium-nurture` (Score 50-69) 
   - `trigger-standard-nurture` (Score <50)
   - `sequence-estate-tax` (Estate planning)
   - `sequence-vc-startup` (Business formation)
   - `sequence-asset-protection` (Brand protection)
   
3. **Triggers appropriate email sequences** automatically
4. **Logs interactions** in your analytics database
5. **Sends to both Mailchimp AND Kit** (dual system during transition)

### **Example Lead Journey:**
```
User fills estate planning form with $3M assets
→ Lead Score: 75 (VIP level)
→ Tags Applied: trigger-vip-sequence + sequence-estate-tax  
→ Gets VIP sequence (5 emails) + Estate tax education (4 emails)
